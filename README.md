# Selenium_TwitterTweet_AutomationTest
Selenium Framwork using POM,  Java, Maven, TestNG for test tweet function on Twitter website "https://twitter.com/home"

## The Project Components and How it Work?
I start Maven project that gives the structure, then add all dependencies need in the project like Selenium, TestNG and POI Apache.
I use POM that consider each web page of website as a class file. each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements.Using these elements, can perform operations on the website under test.

## Features
POM help with easy maintenance of code and readability and reliability of script. Also TestNG can grouped and prioritize test cases more easily and gives the ability to produce HTML Reports.
